## Introduction

This project is to test the Linux and macOS conda packages for [RSMTool](https://github.com/EducationalTestingService/rsmtool). 

To test a new package version that has been already built and uploaded to the official RSMTool conda [channel](http://anaconda.org/desilinguist), create a new branch, change the version number in `version.py` to the version you want to test, and submit a pull request for the branch. This should generally only be done right before doing an RSMTool release.
